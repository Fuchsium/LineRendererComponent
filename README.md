**Line Renderer Component**

This Unreal Engine 4 plugin provides a custom line renderer component that allows you to easily draw lines with thickness in your game or simulation.

The line renderer component is implemented as a C++ component that uses a custom HLSL shader to render the lines. The component exposes a simple API for specifying the geometry of the lines and the thickness of the lines.

The plugin includes a sample project that demonstrates how to use the line renderer component to draw lines in a 3D environment. The sample project includes a simple blueprint actor that generates a random path and uses the line renderer component to draw the path.

Features:

    Draw lines with thickness in your game or simulation
    Simple API for specifying line geometry and thickness
    Custom HLSL shader for fast and efficient rendering
    Easy to integrate with existing Unreal Engine 4 projects
    Includes a sample project that demonstrates how to use the line renderer component
