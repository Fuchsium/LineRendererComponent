Line Renderer Component

This Unreal Engine 4 plugin provides a custom line renderer component that allows you to easily draw lines with thickness in your game or simulation.

The line renderer component is implemented as a C++ component that uses a custom HLSL shader to render the lines. The component exposes a simple API for specifying the geometry of the lines and the thickness of the lines.
